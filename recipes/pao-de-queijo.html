  <img src="img/pao-de-queijo.jpeg" alt="a image of a pão de queijo(cheese bread)">

  <p>Pão de queijo is an typical Brazilian snack, originally from the states Minas Gerais and Goiás. We don't know exactly where and when it originated, but it is suspected that it was around the 18th century, during the slavery period, in the “fazendas mineiras” (farms located in Minas Gerais).Pão de queijo is basically a <em>pate a choux</em>, but made with tapioca flour instead of wheat flour. You can buy them frozen in many grocery stores now, but you can just as easily find the ingredients to make your own pao de queijo from scratch. </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
    <li>3 cups sweet tapioca flour (OR 2 cups sour tapioca flour if you can find it)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt (more if your cheese is not very salty)</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>4 ounces grated cheese</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Set oven to 400ºF</li>
      <li>Combine milk, butter and oil in a small pot and place over medium-high heat. Bring to boil.</li>
      <li>Put tapioca flour and salt into mixing bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
      <li>Pour in hot milk and mix on low until smooth. It will look soft and stringy. Once cool to touch, mix in the eggs one at a time until fully incorporated.</li>
      <li>Mix in the cheese. If your dough is too runny or soft to scoop, just chill it in the fridge for 30 minutes or longer to let it firm up before scooping!</li>
      <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment and scoop the dough out by large tablespoons, spaced an inch apart. (At this point, you may freeze the tray until the balls are solid, then store the balls in a freezer bag. When ready to bake, just put frozen pao de quiejo on a baking sheet and add an extra 5 minutes to cook time. Do not thaw first.)</li>
      <li>Bake 20-25 minutes until lightly golden and and puffed. The interiors should be soft-set and elastic, but if you want a crispier outside, leave them in for 25-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Eat warm right away or let cool. Leftover pao de queijo can be left to cool completely, then stored at room temperature up to 3 days. Reheat in a low oven before serving (or eat at room temp).</li>
    </ol>
